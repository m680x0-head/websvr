# Japan Police and Japanese people


## JP

Japan police has no dignity individually,
but too much arrogance due to their organizational strength.

So they do these secretly, sometimes forcefully.

- They often use loopholes in the law.
- They sometimes break the law on their scope.
- They use cheap tricks for their own gain.
- They Justify their cheap tricks.

You know, the raped journalist and JP's cheap trick.

And this is a typical Japanese policeman.

- They are extremely stereotyped like an idoit.
- They obey the command, not the law.
- They always use lies, fabrications, falsifications.

As a matter of course, they often use cheap tricks.
Cheap tricks inherited from generation to generation, 
because they are idiotic and can't make new ones.
Their questions and answers are same at all and adding tones, too.
They are puppets of dogmatism, copy-and-paste machines.

They are so huge that it's difficult to make them pay the price.
I think, it's good to make them break themselves by internal stress 
of their organization.

They are criminals and if there is some document about the crime, 
like PANAMA DOCS, they make a part of them foots the bill.
By repeating those, finally becomes fatal for them.
Drive them full of pains until they understand the common sense.
Not the justice, not even the common sense, they have nothing.

## Japanese people

They have no constructive opinions but too much complaints
enough to drive JP go evil.
I think, it's no use that JP is so evil because of Japanese people.
