# Japan Police and Japanese policemen

Japanese policeman is a bule suited monkey of no pride individually,
but too much arrogance due to their organizational strength.

They are so huge that it's difficult to make them pay the price.
I think, it's good to make them break themselves by internal stress 
of their organization.

They are criminals and if there is some document about the crime, 
they make some of them foot the bill.
Round and round, finally becomes fatal for them, I think.
