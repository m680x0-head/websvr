# About gangstalking in Japan

THEY must be punished.

## Method of gangstalking

In Japan, maybe as same as other contries.
THEY make us feel physical pains, mental pains and social pains.

A physical pain, THEY use phychotropic drugs.
We feel like choked, and have heavy dizzness.
Most of us cannot stand firmly.

A mental pain, THEY make noise 24h around us,
and THEY make nasty rumors to be heard around us.

A social pain, THEY destroy our life bases.
For example, THEY make us fired by using their authority.

THEY repeat them for years and years.
I think this method is made for the limited use and special cases.
Such as trapping for dangerous psychotic patients.
But THEY overuse this method for their own gain.
