# About gangstalking in Japan

Japan Police must be punished.

## Method of gangstalking

In Japan, maybe as same as other contries.
They make us feel physical pains, mental pains and social pains.

A physical pain, they use phychotropic drugs.
We feel like choked, and have heavy dizzness.
Most of us cannot stand firmly.

A mental pain, they make noise 24h around us,
and they make nasty rumors to be heard for us.

A social pain, they destroy our life bases.
For example, they make us fired by using their authority.

They repeat them for years and years.
I think this method is made for the limited use and special cases.
Such as trapping for dangerous psychotic patients.
But JP overuses this method for their own gain.

## Japanese case

JP abuse the gangstalking method for their gain.
The gain is making hidden money and  reinforcement their authority.

JP makes targets, not dangerous but difficult person.
If they have some criminal records or psychological histories,
good for JP because of ease to justify.

JP requests neighbors for cooperation and pays rewards for them.
AND(!!) JP snatches kickbacks. 
Instead of that, JP helps cooperaters if they get into trouble.
And cooperaters help JP in trouble.

Secretly JP does all of them like a "Yakuza".

## Greed and no common sense

Maybe you doubt JP is so dirty.
JP is the cult of greedy bureaucrats and their kamikaze puppets, 
that has the mind of Japanese ARMY/NAVY at WW2.

Maybe you feel suspecious Japanese allows JP to make dirty cheat.
But this is some truth of Japanese.

- No own justice, Japanese wants authorities give standards. 
- No common sense, Japanese doesn't respect the history.
- No growing up, Japanese is just a empty puppet.

Only little bit of Japanese becomes an adult.
So that the authority like JP is an absolute one for typical Japanese.

Japan is the heaven of authorities, authorities can do anything.
I despise them and have to make them pay the price.
