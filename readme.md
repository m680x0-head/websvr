# About gangstalking in Japan

JPD must be punished.

## Method of gangstalking

In Japan, maybe it is as same as other contries.

They make us feel physical pains, mental pains and social pains.

A physical pain, they use phychotropic drugs.
We feel like choked, and have heavy dizzness.
Most of us cannot stand firmly.

A mental pain, they make noise 24h around us,
and they make nasty rumors to be heard for us.

A social pain, they destroy our life bases.
For example, they make us fired by using their authority.

They repeat them for years and years.

I think this method is made for the limited use and special cases.
Such as trapping for dangerous psychotic patients.

But Japanese police overuses this method for their own gain.

## Japanese case

JPD abuse the gangstalking method for their gain.
The gain is making hidden money and  reinforcement their authority.

JPD makes no-dangerous but difficult person as targets.
If they have some criminal records or phycological histories,
that is good for JPD because of ease to justify.

JPD requests neighbors for cooperation and pays rewards for them.
AND!! JPD request rebate. 
Instead of that, JPD helps cooperater if they get into trouble.
And cooperaters help JPD when JPD in trouble.

JPD does all secretly, it is like "Mafia".

## Greed, foolness and no common sense

Maybe you doubt JPD is so dirty.
JPD is the son of Japanese ARMY/NAVY at WW2, 
the bunch of greedy bureaucrats and their kamikaze puppets.

Maybe you feel suspecious Japanese allows JPD to make dirty cheat.
But this is some truth of Japanese.

- No own justice, authorities give standards to Japanese.
- No common sense, Japanese doesn't respect the history.
- No growing up, Japanese mind is like a child.

Only little bit of Japanese becomes an adult.
So that the authority like JPD is an absolute one for typical Japanese.

Japan is the heaven of authorities, authorities can do anything.
I despise them and have to make them pay the price.
