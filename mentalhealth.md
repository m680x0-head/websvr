# Mental health

In Japan, mental health means two means.

- Keep a person no complaint and no disorder in the environment as a slave.
- Give the difficult person the third degree and have him obey.

## Mental health in Japan

Mental health is not at all healthy in Japan.

The difficult person means who is difficult, makes many enemies 
and easy to be sacrificed in his group.

I mentioned gangstalking by Japan Police at JP.md.
JP co-works psychiatrists, and the targets finally get into the mental hospital.
I don't know which has initiative, but they connected by the huge interests.

If the targets in anger sometimes commit crimes.
And JP arrests them, but JP avoids trial by the loophole in the law.
JP treat them as psychotic patients, 
and JP can get them into the hospital without the trial.
The method structed to be handle the targets as psychotic patients.

The mental hospitals get money as hospitalization fee at public expense,
and torture the targets to obey by drugs.
JP makes hidden money from cooperaters' rewards.
A premeditated crime by both of them.

## Psychiatrist in Japan

Japanese don't treat a psychiatrist as a doctor.
Because psychiatrists are bastards who torture socially vulnerables.
Not everyone but a lot of Japanese knows about this.

The psychiatrist change the targets' inter-personal problems 
to their gain.
They are the member of the gangstalking cult as same as JP.
So that it's no use if someone makes them bastards terrible.
